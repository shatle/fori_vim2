h2 ctags
install details
Copy ctags.vim to your plugin directory. 

If the ctags program is not in your PATH, you will need to add the following to your vimrc: 

    let g:ctags_path=<path to your ctags> 

and to enable the display of function names in the status line, you will need to add this: 

    let g:ctags_statusline=1 

Other configuration variables you may want to change are: 

    g:ctags_args 
        Additional arguments to the ctags program. 

    g:ctags_title 
        Set to 1 if you want the function name also displayed in the title bar. 
        This is the default, but if g:ctags_statusline is set to 1, this must also be 
        set to one to show the function name in the title bar. Otherwise, the 
        function name appears only in the status line. 

    generate_tags 
        Set to 1 if you want the script to be started automatically for the supported 
        file types (actually file extensions). Otherwise the script must be started 
        manually with the CTAGS command. 

    g:ctags_regenerate 
        Set to 0 if you don't want the tags database rebuilt each time 
        the buffer is written.

h2 SuperTab
install details
1. Download supertab.vba to any directory. 
2. Open the file in vim ($ vim supertab.vba). 
3. Source the file (:so %).

h2 Taglist
install details
1. Download the taglist.zip file and unzip the files to the $HOME/.vim or the 
    $HOME/vimfiles or the $VIM/vimfiles directory. After this step, you should 
    have the following two files (the directory structure should be preserved): 

         plugin/taglist.vim - main taglist plugin file 
         doc/taglist.txt    - documentation (help) file 

   Refer to the |add-plugin|, |add-global-plugin| and |runtimepath| Vim 
   help pages for more details about installing Vim plugins. 
2. Change to the $HOME/.vim/doc or $HOME/vimfiles/doc or $VIM/vimfiles/doc 
    directory, start Vim and run the ":helptags ." command to process the 
    taglist help file. Without this step, you cannot jump to the taglist help 
    topics. 
3. If the exuberant ctags utility is not present in your PATH, then set the 
    Tlist_Ctags_Cmd variable to point to the location of the exuberant ctags 
    utility (not to the directory) in the .vimrc file. 
4. If you are running a terminal/console version of Vim and the terminal 
    doesn't support changing the window width then set the 
    'Tlist_Inc_Winwidth' variable to 0 in the .vimrc file. 
5. Restart Vim. 
6. You can now use the ":TlistToggle" command to open/close the taglist 
    window. You can use the ":help taglist" command to get more information 
    about using the taglist plugin. 

h2 autocomplpop
INSTALLATION                                                *acp-installation* 

Put all files into your runtime directory. If you have the zip file, extract 
it to your runtime directory. 

You should place the files as follows: 
> 
        <your runtime directory>/plugin/acp.vim 
        <your runtime directory>/doc/acp.txt 
        ... 
< 
If you disgust to jumble up this plugin and other plugins in your runtime 
directory, put the files into new directory and just add the directory path to 
'runtimepath'. It's easy to uninstall the plugin. 

And then update your help tags files to enable fuzzyfinder help. See 
|add-local-help| for details. 

h2 neocomplcache
install details
1: Edit downloaded neocomplcache-*.vba file by Vim and execute ":so %" command. 
2: Execute :NeoComplCacheEnable command or 
let g:neocomplcache_enable_at_startup = 1 
in your .vimrc. 

h2 rubycomplete
install details
copy to .vim/autoload or your global runtime autoload directory.

h2 rails
install details
Extract the zip file to ~/.vim (or vimfiles on Windows).  To use the help, see :help add-local-help.  In a nutshell, :helptags ~/.vim/doc. 

For details, see :help rails 

If you have issues with crashing on tab complete, upgrade Vim to 7.1.147 or newer.  Ubuntu had a release that included a Vim version with this bug.

h2 snipMate
install details
unzip snipMate.zip -d ~/.vim (or equivalent, e.g. $HOME\vimfiles on Windows) 

Keep in mind this will overwrite any files included with older versions of snipMate, including the default *.snippets files for the included filetypes. If you don't want your snippets overwritten, just name them name them differently than the default snippets, e.g. c-mysnips.snippets. 

NOTE: remember to add ":filetype plugin on" to your .vimrc, otherwise snippets will not work! This is one of the most common issue new users face when trying snipMate. 

Remember to run ":helptags ~/.vim/doc" to enable the help.

h2 NERDTree
install details
Unzip the archive into your ~/.vim directory. 
That should put NERD_tree.vim in ~/.vim/plugin and NERD_tree.txt in ~/.vim/doc. 

Run :helptags. 

Go :help NERD_tree.txt for the help page.
